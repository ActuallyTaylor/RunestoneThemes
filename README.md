# Swift Themes
This package is the bare-bones beginning of a repository that will host a plethora of themes converted into Swift compatible colors. It will host a main target `SwiftThemes` which provides color extensions with all of the data for a theme included. 

It will then include other sub-targets such as `RunestoneThemes` that provide themes for other Open Source frameworks that take theme data. 

The eventual goal for this repository is to build ontop of it a drop-in theme engine for iOS and macOS apps.
